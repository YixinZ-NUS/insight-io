# Past Tasks

## 2026-03-23 – Bootstrap Standalone `insight-io`

### What Changed

- created a new standalone repository root for the DB-first target-routing
  project under `insight-io`
- added repo grounding documents:
  - [fullstack-intent-routing-prd.md](prd/fullstack-intent-routing-prd.md)
  - [INTENT_ROUTING_ARCHITECTURE.md](design_doc/INTENT_ROUTING_ARCHITECTURE.md)
  - [INTENT_ROUTING_DATA_MODEL.md](design_doc/INTENT_ROUTING_DATA_MODEL.md)
  - [intent-routing-runtime.md](diagram/intent-routing-runtime.md)
  - [fullstack-intent-routing-task-list.md](tasks/fullstack-intent-routing-task-list.md)
  - [fullstack-intent-routing-e2e.json](features/fullstack-intent-routing-e2e.json)
- added repo-level agent guidance in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) so future work
  is grounded on the new docs and uses the feature list as the verification
  scoreboard
- carried over the backend-first scaffold needed to continue implementation:
  - explicit schema in [001_initial.sql](../backend/schema/001_initial.sql)
  - durable app, target, and source persistence in the backend store
  - target-aware REST routes for app target CRUD and source binding
  - focused backend tests for persistence and target validation
- replaced copied repo docs with standalone versions of [README.md](../README.md)
  and [REST.md](REST.md) so the new repository is self-contained

### Why

- the work had to move from an incremental prototype inside `insightos` into a
  clean standalone project with its own git history
- the new repository needs to be grounded by docs first so implementation stays
  aligned with the target-routing product framing
- the feature tracker has to remain the single pass/fail scoreboard for future
  implementation slices

### Verification

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j4 --target \
  device_store_test \
  rest_server_test

./build/bin/device_store_test
./build/bin/rest_server_test
```
